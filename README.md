# Overview

This notebook explores various machine learning models on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset used for classification tasks. The primary goal is to compare the performance of different algorithms, identify the best model, and visualize the results.
Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each characterized by four features:

    Sepal Length (cm)
    Sepal Width (cm)
    Petal Length (cm)
    Petal Width (cm)

The samples belong to three species:

    Iris-setosa
    Iris-versicolor
    Iris-virginica

# Methodology

    Data Loading and Preprocessing:
        Load the dataset using Pandas.
        Inspect the data for missing values and basic statistics.
        Convert categorical labels into numeric codes.

   # Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Visualize the distribution of features using box plots, histograms, and pair plots.
        Analyze correlations among features using a heatmap.

   # Model Selection:
        Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
        Train various models, including:
            Logistic Regression
            Decision Trees
            Random Forest
            Gradient Boosting
            AdaBoost
            XGBoost
            LightGBM
            CatBoost

   # Model Evaluation:
        Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
        Identify the best model based on accuracy scores.

    Visualization of Results:
        Plot model accuracies using bar plots to compare performance.
        Generate a confusion matrix for the best-performing model.

# Results

    Displayed model accuracies for each algorithm.
    Presented the confusion matrix for the best model, showcasing its performance on the test set.
# Conclusion
